        <h1>Free Resume Checker vs. Paid Tools — Which One Should You Use?</h1>

        <p>
          In the digital-first job market of 2025, resume optimization is no longer optional — it's essential. With most companies using Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes, the chances of your application being seen by a human depend greatly on how well your resume is tailored to the job.
        </p>

        <p>
          This has given rise to a variety of online tools that claim to help you beat the ATS — from free resume checkers to premium subscription platforms. But how do you choose between free vs. paid tools? And is a paid subscription really worth it?
        </p>

        <p>
          In this 5,000-word deep dive, we’ll compare three of the most well-known resume optimization platforms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>🔍 <strong>BrewMyJob</strong> (freemium model)</li>
          <li>💰 <strong>Jobscan</strong> (paid)</li>
          <li>💼 <strong>ResumeWorded</strong> (limited free / paid)</li>
        </ul>
