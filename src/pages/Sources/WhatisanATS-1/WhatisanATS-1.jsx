        <h1>What is an ATS and How to Beat It in 2025</h1>

        <p>
          In today’s competitive job market, applying online often feels like sending your resume into a black hole. If you’ve applied for dozens of jobs without hearing back, you’re not alone — and the problem might not be your qualifications, but how your resume is being filtered by ATS software.
        </p>

        <h2>🤖 What is an ATS?</h2>
        <p>
          An <strong>Applicant Tracking System (ATS)</strong> is software used by employers and recruiters to manage job applications. Think of it as a robot assistant that scans, filters, and ranks resumes <em>before a human even sees them</em>. These systems are designed to streamline the hiring process by eliminating resumes that don't match specific job criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to recent surveys, over 95% of Fortune 500 companies use ATS software like Workday, Greenhouse, or Taleo. Even smaller companies now use some form of resume screening automation, making it essential for job seekers to understand how to optimize their resumes.
        </p>

        <p>
          ATS software scans for keyword relevance, proper formatting, and overall compatibility with the job description. It reduces the recruiter’s workload by filtering out applications that don’t meet the basic requirements. Unfortunately, this also means that even strong candidates might get filtered out due to poor formatting or missing keywords.
        </p>

        <h2>🚫 Why Resumes Get Rejected by ATS</h2>
        <p>The ATS doesn’t read resumes like a human would. Instead, it parses the text and compares it to the job description to look for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Relevant keywords (e.g., “JavaScript”, “project management”)</li>
          <li>Job titles and experience levels</li>
          <li>Skills and qualifications</li>
          <li>Formatting issues (e.g., weird fonts, tables, or unreadable PDFs)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many resumes fail to pass the ATS scan because they use overly designed templates, include non-standard section titles, or omit important keywords. Understanding how ATS software evaluates resumes is the first step to getting past this barrier.
        </p>

        <h2>✅ How to Beat the ATS in 2025</h2>
        <p>Beating the ATS means optimizing your resume so it gets seen. Here's how:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use the Right Keywords:</strong> Tailor your resume to each job posting. Use exact matches to the skills and tools listed in the job description.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid Fancy Formatting:</strong> Stick to clean, simple layouts. ATS systems often struggle with tables, graphics, and columns.</li>
          <li><strong>Use a Standard File Type:</strong> Prefer .docx or PDF formats. Make sure the file isn’t scanned or image-based.</li>
          <li><strong>Customize for Each Role:</strong> Highlight what matches the job and remove unrelated experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Use an ATS Resume Checker:</strong> Let tools like BrewMyJob do the hard work for you. These tools can instantly tell you what you’re missing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Another tip is to use clear, ATS-friendly section headings like “Work Experience,” “Education,” and “Skills.” This ensures that the system can identify and categorize your content properly.
        </p>
