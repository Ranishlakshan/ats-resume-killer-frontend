        <h1>How to Improve Your Resume‚Äôs ATS Score in 10 Minutes</h1>

        <p>
          In 2025, your resume's first reader is likely not a human ‚Äî it's an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). These software tools filter resumes by checking for the right keywords, structure, and formatting. If your resume isn't optimized for ATS, you may never get that interview call ‚Äî no matter how qualified you are.
        </p>

        <p>
          The good news? You can improve your resume's ATS score in just 10 minutes ‚Äî with tools like <strong>BrewMyJob</strong> that provide instant keyword analysis, formatting tips, and AI-powered suggestions.
        </p>

        <h2>üß† What is an ATS Score?</h2>
        <p>
          An <strong>ATS Score</strong> is a measure of how well your resume matches a given job description, based on factors like keyword usage, skill relevance, structure, and formatting. Most recruiters use this score (either implicitly or via software) to rank candidates.
        </p>

        <h2>‚ö° Step-by-Step: Improve Your Score Fast</h2>
        <h3>1. Upload Your Resume + Job Description</h3>
        <p>Go to <a href="/">BrewMyJob</a> and paste your job description. Upload your resume or paste the content into the editor. Our engine scans the job and analyzes your resume instantly.</p>

        <h3>2. Review the Compatibility Score</h3>
        <p>BrewMyJob will return a score from 0‚Äì100 indicating how closely your resume matches the job requirements.</p>

        <h3>3. Check the Missing Keywords</h3>
        <p>The platform highlights the exact keywords missing from your resume, especially in areas like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Technical Skills (e.g., JavaScript, SQL, Agile)</li>
          <li>Soft Skills (e.g., Leadership, Communication)</li>
          <li>Certifications or Tools (e.g., PMP, HubSpot, AWS)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Edit Directly in the Editor</h3>
        <p>
          Make quick edits to your resume using the AI editor provided. Add a "Skills" section or tweak job descriptions to include relevant keywords naturally.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Improve Headings & Structure</h3>
        <p>
          ATS systems prefer standard headings like <strong>"Work Experience"</strong>, <strong>"Skills"</strong>, <strong>"Education"</strong>. Avoid custom headings like "Career Highlights" or "My Journey" ‚Äî they may not get parsed correctly.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Use Bullet Points & Action Verbs</h3>
        <p>
          Write concise bullet points that include measurable achievements. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>{`‚Ä¢ Reduced customer complaints by 35% through redesigned support process
‚Ä¢ Managed a $500K project and delivered 2 weeks ahead of deadline`}</pre>

        <h3>7. Recheck the Score</h3>
        <p>
          Once you've made edits, click ‚ÄúRecheck ATS Score.‚Äù Your score will likely jump by 20‚Äì40 points in just one round of optimization.
