        <p>
          The job market in 2025 continues to be fiercely competitive. With most recruiters receiving hundreds of applications for a single position, a well-crafted cover letter can make your application stand out. Yet writing one from scratch can be time-consuming, stressful, and — if done wrong — ineffective.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s why many job seekers are now turning to AI-powered tools like <strong>BrewMyJob</strong> to help create personalized, impactful cover letters in minutes. This guide walks you through:

        <h2>📌 Why Cover Letters Still Matter in 2025</h2>
        <p>
          While some companies have made cover letters optional, the truth is: a tailored, compelling letter can still significantly improve your chances. According to LinkedIn and Glassdoor hiring surveys, candidates who submit cover letters are 40% more likely to get callbacks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recruiters use it to gauge personality, communication skills, cultural fit, and enthusiasm for the role. In a sea of AI-generated resumes and templated formats, a thoughtfully written letter gives you a human edge — especially when powered by smart AI suggestions.
        </p>

        <h2>🧱 Basic Structure of a Modern Cover Letter</h2>
        <p>The typical format of a 2025-ready cover letter includes:</p>

          <li><strong>Greeting:</strong> Addressing the hiring manager by name</li>
          <li><strong>Opening paragraph:</strong> State the job you’re applying for and grab their attention</li>
          <li><strong>Middle paragraph(s):</strong> Demonstrate why you’re a great fit using real accomplishments</li>
          <li><strong>Closing paragraph:</strong> Call to action — show your enthusiasm to interview</li>
